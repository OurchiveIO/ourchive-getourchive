With Ourchive, you can create an account, upload works, create bookmarks and collections of bookmarks, and comment on others' works, bookmarks, and collections.

Ourchive aims to continue a tradition that archives like eFiction started. When you install Ourchive, you get flexible metadata like tags, the ability to upload images and audio, and the ability to administer users, all within an easily installed Django website.
